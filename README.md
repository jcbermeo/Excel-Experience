# Macros

This file contains an automated Excel process (Macro) that helps with the registering and calculation of an employee's total funds and his/her data. There is also the file called **EnterToTable_MacroCode** which has the entire code of the macro used in the file. 

**How does it work?**
Add **Last Name, Name, Position, Salary, Children and Extra Hours** of the employee. Then **click** over the **Enter Button**. This will transpose the information of the employee and calculate **Family Bonus, Extra Hours Value, Health-Care and Funds**
